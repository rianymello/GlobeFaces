# GlobeFaces

[Portuguese Version](./README.md) | [Versión en Español](./README_ES.md)

**GlobeFaces** is a facial recognition dataset and model focused on global representativeness, intersectionality (race, gender, age, and underrepresented facial features), and reduction of algorithmic bias.

## Objective

To develop a *facial recognition model and dataset* that addresses diversity limitations found in models like FairFace, focusing on:

- **Intersectional representativeness**:
  - Expanding racial categorization to include regional variations (e.g., Brazilian indigenous peoples, North Africans, mixed heritage).
  - Representing **underrepresented facial features** (e.g., disabilities, birthmarks, deformities, use of turbans/scarves/glasses).

- **Algorithmic bias mitigation**:
  - Using robust fairness metrics (such as *Equalized Odds*, *Disparate Impact*) to evaluate the model.
  - Creating a pipeline that enables comparison of results across different subgroups.

- **Open tools for the community**:
  - Providing code, documentation, and metrics in a GitHub repository.
  - Offering APIs and simple interfaces for researchers and developers to test and contribute.
